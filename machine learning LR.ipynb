    "Ans:Interpret the slope: If the speed of the club hitting the ball increases by 1 mph, then the model predicts that the length the ball travels increases by 57.66 yards. Interpret the intercept: If the ball is hit with a speed of 0 mph, then the model predicts that the length the ball travels will be 3.18 yards.\n"

    "ans:Gradient descent (GD) is an iterative first-order optimisation algorithm, used to find a local minimum/maximum of a given function. This method is commonly used in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to minimise a cost/loss function    (eg. in a linear regression)."

    "ans:Multiple regression is a broader class of regressions that encompasses linear and nonlinear regressions with multiple explanatory variables. Whereas linear regress only has one independent variable impacting the slope of the relationship, multiple regression incorporates multiple independent variables."

    "ans:Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are correlated. This correlation is a problem because independent variables should be independent. If the degree of correlation between variables is high enough, it can cause problems when you fit the model and interpret the results."

It is used when linear regression models may not adequately capture the complexity of the relationship."
